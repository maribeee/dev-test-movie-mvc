# About This Project

This was an assessment for a job application, it was completed in two hours, and I was hired based on this assessment 

It is a movie library app created in Laravel (php) with some VueJS components, demonstrating an MVC app with a VueJS frontend.


## Overview of Work

The following is a list of what code was written for this test and where within the Laravel folder structure you can find it:

* app/Http/Controllers/MoviesController.php
  * This is the controller that manages Movie API calls
* app/Models/
  * /Movie.php
  * /User.php
    * These are the models for the Movie and User objects
* database/factories/...
  * These are the factories that tell the seeders what data to seed into the database
* database/migrations/...
  * These are the migrations for the database structure
* database/seeders
  * Seeders which use factories to input dummy test data into the database
* public/img/...
  * Where images are stored (in this case just a hero image)
* resources/js/Components
  * /Movie.vue
  * /Movies.vue
    * These are the singular movie and multiple movies list components
* resources/js/shared/services/...
  * This is an Axios service that I created that allows you to access the database using axios calls more simply within the actual vue components. For example, instead of putting the full code for an axios call directly inside of Movies.vue, you can instead use the one line call: MovieRepo.getAllMovies();
* resources/js/app.js
  * This is where the vue app and components are initialized (this is a SPA)
* resources/sass/...
  * pre-compiled sass
* routes/api.php
  * routing info for the API, which points to the appropriate functions within the movie controller
* routes/web.php
  * Routing for the root page (and where any other page routing would go)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
